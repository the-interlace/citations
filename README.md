# Citations interlay

Links between documents are widely used for context, support, validation, argument compression, and 'see also' style bibliographies.
They are essential to discovery and search online, metrics from pagerank to h-index, indexes and sitemaps, and attribution.

Within the broader scope of linking, citations are used for bibliometrics, argument justification, data sourcing, fact checking, and acknowledging past work in desribing the arc of discovery or analysis.

Despite this centrality, citations are not generally treated as a first-class element in writing, publishing, or cataloging.  It is difficult to annotate and talk about cites; they have no common global identifiers; and the intent of citing is essential in context but ignored in bulk by almost all uses.
