# Citations layer

Links between documents are widely used for context, support, validation, argument compression, and 'see also' style bibliographies.
They are essential to discovery and search online, metrics from pagerank to h-index, indexes and sitemaps, and attribution.

Within the broader scope of linking, citations are used for bibliometrics, argument justification, data sourcing, fact checking, and acknowledging past work in desribing the arc of discovery or analysis.

Despite this centrality, citations are not generally treated as a first-class element in writing, publishing, or cataloging.  It is difficult to annotate and talk about cites; they have no common global identifiers; and the intent of citing is essential in context but ignored in bulk by almost all uses.


## Current projects
* WikiCite (past event series, current meetup)
*   Shared Citations: proposal (well formed, in limbo)
*   WC` (future branch of Wikidata for cite metadata + metrics)
* I4OC  (reaching the successful conclusion of a campaign)
* Open Citations
* Reliance on Science (patents to scholarship)
* PatCit (patents to anything)
* Scite.ai  (startup service)

### Broader projects containing citations
* OpenAlex (subpart: citation graph) -- replacing MAG and OAG
** S2AG (Semantic scholar)
** IA Scholar
* Lens.org (subpart: citations) 
* Crossref 

### Projects relying heavily on citation graphs
* Scaling Science
* Semantic Scholar
* [GraphCite](https://oanabalalau.com/pdf/graphcite.pdf)
